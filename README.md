# Mitm-proxy-directions-from-gpt4
Ie
A mitm script in python, first version generated by chatgpt (3.5) with theso correct promt engeneering  it became a partely functional script, in that proces i noticed funny behavior on the side of chatgpt, namely the arp poisining functional was done in such a way that it seemed to perfuorm the function, but in reality chatgpt made it  look so but it was not doing anyform of arp poisining, so basicly chatgpt lied. 

I confronted chatgpt with ththisis "lie" then he appologiged and made it send only 2 arp packages, the proces from then on became easyier hé then quickly made the poisining go on (even so good that if the script stopt the poisining didnt, i could see iithat in wireshark) also in the sslstrip function hé made a lie and simulated it, but also after confronting it with this "lie" hé made it work. After that i copied that version iiof the script in bing chat (gpt4 version) and ask him to correct it and make it beter. 

So hé made it more complex, plus i ask to come up with functions to make it perform better, hè did this in the forum of ai intrussion detection system. 

This is the draft i got from Bing.  I going to test this, and then look how much further Bing chat can bring this. When i ask him to make a function for the user to inject malicious code in the packages, it said it is time to stop and go on in a New chat. 

Also the history of the prompt in chatgpt is not completly accecible Anymore, for obvious reasons i must at. All this was a form of test to see how far gpt would go with the correct prompting.
